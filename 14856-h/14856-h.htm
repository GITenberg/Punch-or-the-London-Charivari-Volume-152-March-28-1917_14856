    <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

    <p>Charged at Kingston with being an absentee from military
    service, a man of retiring habits stated that he did not know
    the country was at war. When told that we were fighting the
    Germans he was greatly interested.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The Hamburg hotel-keepers have decided to abolish the
    practice of charging more for food in cases where wine or beer
    are not consumed. The reason given&mdash;that there was no wine
    or beer to be consumed&mdash;is so trivial that a deeper motive
    may well be suspected.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"That is how we lawyers live, because lay-men have such
    queer ideas," said Judge CLUER in a recent case. Nevertheless,
    the view that lawyers shouldn't be allowed to live is not
    without its ardent supporters.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>The Manchester Guardian</i> has issued an "Empire
    number." It is pleasant to know that all differences between
    the Empire and our contemporary, due to the former's
    ill-advised participation in the War, have been satisfactorily
    adjusted.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Events have happened so swiftly of late that up to the time
    of going to press a contemporary had not decided who should be
    "<i>The Man who Dined with the Tsar</i>."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Virginia-creepers are recommended by a contemporary as a
    "tasty vegetable." In one large house where the experiment was
    tried they were pronounced to be quite all right on the second
    floor, but rather tough in the basement.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The businesses of Southgate men called to the colours are
    being conducted by a committee. Small sons of those absent
    fathers are going very warily until they have ascertained
    exactly how far the powers of the committee extend.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Writing on the German retreat Major MORAHT says: "Only a
    personality like that of Marshal von Hindenburg could give
    proofs of so great an initiative." Possibly he has never heard
    of the Dukes of York and Plaza Toro.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A boy of eleven charged with the theft of clothes is said to
    have stolen the notebook of the policeman who arrested him. His
    first idea was to pinch his captor's whistle, but he rejected
    this plan on finding that the policeman was attached to it.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Russian soldiers under the new <i>r&eacute;gime</i> will be
    allowed to smoke in the streets, travel inside trains, visit
    clubs and attend political meetings. There is a very strong
    rumour that they will also be allowed to go on fighting.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A ten-months-old boy at Prescot, Lancashire, has been called
    up for military service. It is, however, authoritatively stated
    that this is merely a precautionary measure on the part of the
    War Office, and will not necessarily apply to other men in the
    same class.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A Bromley gentleman is advertising for a chauffeur "to drive
    Ford car out of cab-yard." Kindness is a great thing in cases
    of this sort, and we suggest trying to entice it out with a
    piece of cheese.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"You have lost the privilege of serving on the last grand
    jury during the War," said the judge at the London Sessions
    last week to a shipowner who arrived at the court late. We
    understand that the poor fellow broke down and sobbed
    bitterly.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Nearly every Russian newspaper contains congratulatory
    references to Free Russia, and poets are busy composing verses
    on the same theme. It is this latter item which is said to be
    keeping the Germans from having a similar revolution.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We understand that the new "No Smoking near Magazines"
    enactment is profoundly resented in editorial circles.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>To fill the gap which will be left in the ranks of
    Parliamentary humorists by the retirement of Mr. JOSEPH KING,
    M.P., who has decided not to seek re-election, the Variety
    Artistes Federation have nominated a candidate for the Brixton
    Division.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"On whatever day you sow your wheat," says Miss MARIE
    CORELLI, "you cannot stop its growing on Sundays." Mr. HALL
    CAINE has not yet spoken on this point, and his silence is
    regarded as significant.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Incidentally we are not so sure that you cannot stop wheat
    growing on Sundays. There is good precedent for plucking its
    ears on the Sabbath, and that ought to stop it.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The KAISER, it appears, is much annoyed at the CROWN PRINCE
    and the way he has mis-managed so many brilliant opportunities.
    It is even suggested in some quarters that the KAISER has
    threatened, if LITTLE WILLIE does not improve, to abdicate in
    his favour.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A respectably dressed man was recently arrested for behaving
    in a strange manner in Downing Street. Others have done the
    same thing before now, but have escaped the notice of the
    police by doing it indoors.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>With reference to the taxi-cab which stopped in the Strand
    the other day when hailed by a pedestrian, a satisfactory
    explanation is to hand. It had broken down.</p>

    <h2>RATIONS.</h2>

    <p>As I said to John, I can bear anger and sarcasm&mdash;but
    contempt, not. Binny and Joe are our cats, and the most
    pampered of pets. Every day, when our meals were served, there
    was spread upon the carpet a newspaper, on which Binny and Joe
    would trample, clamouring, until a plate containing their
    substantial portion was laid down: after which we were free to
    proceed with our own meal.</p>

    <p>Then came the paralysing shock of Lord DEVONPORT'S ration
    announcement, in which no mention is made of cats. Binny and
    Joe looked at one another in consternation over their porridge
    as I read aloud his statement from the newspaper at
    breakfast.</p>

    <p>When I came in to luncheon I had a letter in my hand and
    accidentally dropped the envelope. Paper of any kind upon the
    carpet is associated in Binny's mind with the advent of food.
    Straightway he thudded from his arm-chair and sat down upon the
    envelope. You will notice that I speak above of Binny and Joe.
    I do so instinctively, because, though Binny is only half Joe's
    age of one year, somehow he always occurs everywhere before
    Joe. Joe was lying on the same arm-chair, and the same idea
    struck him too; but Binny got there first and continued sitting
    on the envelope, until, for very shame, I asked Ann, the maid,
    to spread a newspaper and try them with potato and gravy. They
    looked at it and then at me, and then, without tasting, walked
    off and began their usual after-luncheon ablutions of mouth,
    face and paws. But, as I have said, I can endure sarcasm.</p>

    <p>The next day, just before luncheon, a mass of sparrow
    feathers was found on the hall-mat. The second day there were
    feathers of a blackbird. And the third day, when I came down to
    breakfast, I found a few thrush feathers carelessly left under
    the breakfast-room table. I began to search my mind, anxiously
    wondering whether any of my near neighbours kept chickens.</p>

    <p>But the matter was settled that night. When the dinner-gong
    sounded, Binny and Joe rose from their arm-chair, looked at the
    vegetarian dishes now adorning a board which had been wont to
    send up savoury meaty steams (fish in these parts has become a
    rarity almost unprocurable, and we had exhausted our allowance
    of meat at luncheon, which we had taken at a restaurant), and
    then, with noses in the air and tails erect, stalked haughtily
    to the drawing-room, and there remained until dinner was
    finished.</p>

    <p>So now the butcher leaves two pennorth of lights at my door
    regularly. He assures me that Lord DEVONPORT won't mind as it
    is not strictly human food.</p>

    <h2>THE WATCH DOGS.</h2>

    <p class="center">LVIII.</p>

    <p>MY DEAR CHARLES,&mdash;Recent events calling for strong
    comment, I turned to my friend, my brick-red friend who is able
    to retain his well-fed prosperous look notwithstanding the
    rigours of trench life, Rrobert James McGrregor. I took a map
    with me and, calling his attention to the general position,
    asked him what about it? McGregor, as you may guess, is a Scot,
    whose national sense of economy seems to have spread to his
    uniform, in that the cap he wears covers but a third-part of
    his head, and his tunic (which I ought really not to call a
    tunic but a service jacket) appears to have exhausted itself
    and its material at the fourth button. Notwithstanding all
    this, I attach great weight to his truculent views, and, the
    better to incite him into something outright, addressed him in
    My best Scottish, which is, at any rate, as good as his best
    English. "Rrrrrobert," I said, "what like is the VON HINDENBURG
    line?" Whereupon McGregor, helping himself to our mess whisky
    and cursing it as the vilest production of this vile War, spoke
    out.</p>

    <p>McGregor has no respect whatever for HINDENBURG or anything
    which is his. He says that HINDENBURG and his crew have all
    along taken the line which any man could, but no gentleman
    would. In HINDENBURG he sees the personification of Prussian
    militarism, and for the Prussians and their militarism he has
    no use whatsoever. I forget what exactly is the Highland phrase
    for "no use whatsoever," but its meaning is even worse than its
    sound, and the sound of it alone is terrible to hear. Whatever
    befalls in the interval, it is certain that when at last
    McGregor and HINDENBURG meet they will not get on well
    together.</p>

    <p>McGregor hates militarism. It is entirely inconsistent with
    his wild ideas of liberty. As such he is determined to do it
    down on all occasions and by every means. Not only is he a
    Scot, he is also a barrister of the most pronounced type. Brief
    him in your cause, and provided it is not a mean one he will
    set out to lay flat the whole earth, if need be, in its
    defence. He will overwhelm opposing counsel with the mere
    ferocity of his mien; he will overbear the Judge himself with
    the mere power of his lungs, and he will carry you through to a
    verdict with the mere momentum of his loyal support. Once he
    has made a cause his own, no other cause can survive the terror
    of his bushy eyebrows and his flaring face. He is a caged lion,
    but he does not grow thin or wasted in captivity. As ever, he
    grows stout and strong on his own enthusiasms. The cage will
    not hold much longer. Heaven be praised, it's HINDENBURG and
    not me he's taken a dislike to.</p>

    <p>He loathes militarism. Having waited nearly thirty years for
    a fight, it's himself is overjoyed that he has Prussian
    militarism for the victim of his murderous designs. To this end
    he has become a soldier, such a bloodthirsty soldier as never
    was before and never will be again. The thoroughness of it, for
    an anti-militarist, is almost appalling. The click of his heels
    and the shine of his buttons frighten me. His salute is such
    that even the most deserving General must pause and ask himself
    if it is humanly possible to merit such respect as it
    indicates. No man, even upon the most legitimate instance, may
    venture, in the presence of the dangerous McGregor, the
    slightest criticism of the British Army or of anything remotely
    appertaining thereto. He will not even permit a sly dig, in a
    quiet corner, at the Staff.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless McGregor hates, loathes and detests militarism.
    His convictions are quite clear and convincing. Soldiers are
    one thing; militarists are another. Rrobert James McGrregor,
    for the moment at least, is by the grace of God and the
    generosity of His Majesty a soldier. That creature HINDENBURG
    is a militarist. Quite so, I agreed; but then what about the
    line? He helped himself to some more whisky, showing that he
    could forgive anybody anything except a Prussian his
    militarism, and said he was coming to that. But first as to
    HINDENBURG.</p>

    <p>The man represents his type and is, says McGregor, a mere
    bully. He has become a bully because he could succeed as
    nothing else. Given peace, it is doubtful if he could get and
    keep the job of errand-boy in a second-rate butcher's shop.
    Lacking the intelligence or spirit to succeed normally, he has
    not the decency to live quietly in the cheaper suburbs of
    Berlin and let other people do it. Flourish they must,
    HINDENBURG and his lot, and so the world is at war to keep
    their end up.</p>

    <p>Now, says McGregor, it is undoubtedly sinful to fight, but
    he can't help half forgiving those whose desire to have a round
    is such that they must needs cause the bothers. But do I
    suppose that HINDENBURG ever wanted to fight, ever meant or
    ever means to do it? Not he; and that is why the War goes on
    and on and on. We've got to work through all the other Germans,
    says he, before we'll get to their militarists, who are all
    alive and doing nicely, thank you, behind. When we are getting
    near the throat of the first of them then the War will end.</p>

    <p>McGregor cannot bring himself to detest all the Bosches.
    After all, he says, they do stick it out, and their very
    stupidity makes some call on his generosity. But HINDENBURG, he
    is convinced, never stuck anything out, except snubs from his
    competitor, WILHELM, in the course of his uprising career; he
    makes no call on anybody's generosity, taking everything he
    wants, including (says McGregor) the best cigars. Without ever
    having studied them closely, McGregor has the most precise
    ideas of HINDENBURG'S daily life and habits. He is quite sure
    he smokes all day the most expensive cigars, without paying for
    them or removing the bands. He rose, says McGregor, by artifice
    combined with ostentation. While his good soldiers were
    studying their musketry, he was practising ferocious
    expressions before his glass. If he ever did get mixed up in a
    real battle (which McGregor doubts) he was undoubtedly last in
    and first out. However it may appear in print, his military
    career would not bear close scrutiny; for that reason McGregor
    does not propose to scrutinise it. And as for his indomitable
    will, he sees nothing to admire in the man's persistence,
    since, when he stops persisting, he'll become ungummed and, at
    the best, forgotten.</p>

    <p>So said McGregor, and when I besought him to come to the
    point, he said he'd dealt with it, and if I had any sympathy
    left for HINDENBURG or his line I was no better than a
    slave-driving, sit-at-home-and-push-others-over-the-parapet
    Prussian militarist myself. As for the map, it didn't matter in
    the least where HINDENBURG took his old line to, since wherever
    in Europe it endeavoured to conceal itself his own little line
    would scent it out and follow it. And if the HINDENBURG line
    was more than two hundred miles long and the Rrobert James
    McGrregor line less than two hundred yards, still it didn't
    matter; for when a Scot takes a dislike to somebody, that
    somebody's number is up.</p>

    <p>McGregor didn't say that last, but he looked it.</p>

    <p>"Did you hear that?" cried the white hen.</p>

    <p>"He called us&mdash;cluck-cluck-cluck," said the white

    <p>"Why shouldn't he?" asked all the other hens.</p>

    <p>"I didn't mean he called us 'cluck-cluck-cluck,'" said the
    white hen hastily. "I was only choking with rage when I said
    that. He called us&mdash;cluck-cluck-cluck&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"She's going to lay an egg," said the black hen with

    <h2>THE FAVORITE.</h2>

    <p>Some people would die rather than talk aloud in a 'bus;
    others would rather die than hold their peace there. This
    second kind is more fun, and four of it made part of my journey
    the other day from Victoria to Oxford Street (I forget the
    number of the 'bus, but it goes up Bond Street) much less
    tedious. They were all young women in the latest teens or the
    earliest twenties, and all were what is called well-to-do, and
    they were fluent talkers.</p>

    <p>Years ago, when poor LEWIS WALLER was at the height of his
    fame, we used to hear of a real or fictitious "Waller Club,"
    the members of which were young women who spent as much time as
    they could in visiting his theatre and rejoicing in the sight
    of his brave gestures and the sound of his vibrant voice. It
    was even said that they had a badge by which they could know
    each other; although on the face of it, judging by what sparse
    scraps of information concerning the nature of woman I have
    been able painfully to collect, I should say that segregation
    would be, in such a case as this, more to their taste.</p>

    <p>Be that true or only invented, it is very clear that in
    spite of the War and its shattering way with so many ancient
    shibboleths the cult of the actor is still strong; for this is
    the kind of thing that lasted all the way from Hyde Park Corner
    to Vere Street:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Did you see him the other day in that ballet? Of course I
    knew he could dance, because he can do everything, but I never
    thought he was going to be so gloriously graceful as he
    was."</p>

    <p>"But surely you ought to have known. Don't you remember him
    as the Prince at the LORD MAYOR'S Ball?"</p>

    <p>"And what a wonderful figure he has!"</p>

    <p>"I couldn't help wishing that he had only stained his legs
    instead of putting on red tights."</p>

    <p>"My dear!!!"</p>

    <p>"It's his grace that's the wonderful thing about him, I
    always think. His ease. He moves so&mdash;how shall I put
    it?&mdash;so, well, so easily and gracefully."</p>

    <p>"Don't you love him when he stands with his hands in his
    pockets?"</p>

    <p>"My dear, yes. But what a wonderful tailor he goes to. I
    always used to tell my brother to try and find out where his
    things were made and go to the same place."</p>

    <p>"But of course it's the way clothes are worn much more than
    the clothes themselves. I mean, some men can never look well
    dressed, whereas others can look well in anything."</p>

    <p>"But he does go to the best tailor, I'm sure."</p>

    <p>"How many times have you seen this new piece?"</p>

    <p>"Six."</p>

    <p>"Only six! I've seen it eleven."</p>

    <p>"I've seen it three times."</p>

    <p>"I've seen it five times; but one of those doesn't count,
    because when we got there we found he was ill with chicken-pox.
    Wasn't that rotten luck?"</p>

    <p>"I heard he had been ill, but I didn't know what it was. Was
    it really chicken-pox?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, poor darling."</p>

    <p>"Fancy him having a thing like that! I suppose it's part of
    the price of keeping so young."</p>

    <p>"Oh, yes, isn't he young!"</p>

    <p>"They say this thing's going to run for years."</p>

    <p>"I hope not. I want to see him in something new. It's so
    wonderful how he's always the same and yet always
    different."</p>

    <p>"I want him to be in every play. I never go to one without
    thinking how much better he would be than the other leading
    man."</p>

    <p>"I saw that little what's-his-name imitate him the other
    evening. Really it's rather a shame."</p>

    <p>"Yes, I've seen it. I couldn't help laughing, but I hated
    myself for it. I'm sure, too, he doesn't waggle his head like
    that."</p>

    <p>"No! I couldn't see the point of that at all; but the people
    shrieked."</p>

    <p>"Pooh, they'd laugh at anything."</p>

    <p>"What did you like him best of all in?"</p>

    <p>"That's difficult. Of course he was priceless as the
    policeman. But then he was priceless as the American too, in
    that thing before this."</p>

    <p>"Well, I think&mdash;"</p>

    <p>And so on. Except that I never mention his name, and I have
    suppressed the titles of the plays, this is practically an
    exact reproduction of the conversation. Naturally many of the
    sentences overlapped, for ladies no less than gentlemen often
    talk at the same time; but otherwise I have reported
    faithfully.</p>

    <p>And who was the subject of these eulogies? You will guess at
    once when I say that he is probably the only actor in history
    who is referred to more often by his Christian name only than
    by his surname or full name. These young women who adored
    WALLER spoke of him not as LEWIS, but as LEWIS WALLER; and that
    is the usual custom. The divine SARAH is perhaps the only other
    histrion, and she is a woman, who may be spoken of simply as
    SARAH, with no risk of ambiguity. Ordinarily, as I say, we use
    either the surname only or the surname and Christian name
    combined, as ELLEN TERRY, VIOLET LORAINE, GEORGE GRAVES, GEORGE
    ROBEY, LESLIE HENSON, NELSON KEYS. But these four devotees
    referred to their hero always as GERALD; just GERALD.</p>

    <h2>THE POULTICE.</h2>

    <p>Call this cold? You orter been with me in '63, when I was
    whalin' in the North Atlantic. I was steward on the <i>Ella
    Wheeler</i>, 6,000 tons, out from New Caledonia. Our skipper
    was a reg'lar old bluenose, and some Tartar, I <i>don't</i>
    think! Why, 'e'd lay yer out sooner than look at yer; an' once
    'e put the cook in irons for two days 'cos the poor devil 'ad
    tumbled up against the side of the galley an' burnt the 'air
    off the side of 'is 'ead, and the old man said it was untidy;
    and we all 'ad to 'ave cold grub for two days&mdash;and in them
    latitudes! Lord, 'ow we 'ated 'im!</p>

    <p>But the worst of it was that we 'ad no doctor on board, and
    when anybody took sick the old man insisted on doctorin' 'im
    'isself; and 'e 'ad only one way of treatin' every disease in
    the 'orspitals. "Put 'im into 'is bunk," he says, "and wait
    till I bring 'im a 'ot linseed poultice for's chest."
    Tooth-ache or chilblains, a pain in yer stummick or
    ring-worm&mdash;'e always says the same thing, "Put 'im in his
    bunk," he says, "and I'll bring 'im a 'ot linseed poultice for
    's chest." And 'e brought it and put it on with 'is own 'ands
    too! There was no gettin' out of it if once 'e 'eard you were
    sick. Lord, 'ow we 'ated 'im!</p>

    <p>There was Pete Malone&mdash;'ad a great mop of 'air like a
    lion or a musician&mdash;must needs go washing one day on deck,
    like a fool. It was all right as long as 'e 'ad the 'ot water
    and the soapsuds goin'; but 'e give 'is 'ead a rinse, an' stood
    up, and, swelpme, before 'e could get the towel to work every
    single 'air 'e 'd got 'ad its own private icicle, an' 'is silly
    'ead looked like a silver-plated porkypine.</p>

    <p>Well, as I was saying, we were about a 'undred-and-fifty
    mile from the nearest land, which 'ud be the West coast of
    Greenland, bearin' about E. by N., when we thought that at last
    we were going' to get one back on the old man. It was this way.
    One bitter cold night 'e was makin' 'is way aft to turn in,
    when 'e slips up where a wave 'ad froze on the deck, an' e'
    goes wallop down the 'ole length of the companion, from top to
    bottom, an' busts three of 'is ribs. Of course we all ran an'
    picked 'im up, an' <i>said</i> we 'oped 'e wasn't much 'urt.
    But 'e says, "None of yer jabber, ye swines; 'elp me inter my
    bunk, and two of yer bring me a 'ot linseed poultice for my
    chest."</p>

    <p>Well, we puts 'im in 'is bunk, and I catches the eye of the
    first mate, and we goes out together. "Mick," says I, "'e's
    askin' for a 'ot poultice. Lord send there's a good fire in the
    galley!" "If there ain't," says Micky to me, "we'll damn'd soon
    make one." So we makes a fire such as none of the ship's
    company 'ad ever seen; and we gets two buckets of water, one
    very near full, and the other about a quarter full, and we soon
    'as 'em both on the boil. Then we makes the poultice in the
    drop of water; and when 'e was ready, we gets the grid and puts
    it across the top of the other bucket, and lays the poultice on
    the grid, and me and the mate picks up the full bucket with two
    pair o' tongs, 'olding a torch under 'er to keep 'er at the
    boil.</p>

    <p>When the old man saw us 'is face twisted a bit! But talk
    about cold! We slapped the poultice on to 'im, and, if you'll
    believe me, inside o' ninety seconds the thing 'ad <i>froze
    'ard on 'im</i>, and formed a splint, and&mdash;saved 'is life,
    blarst 'im!</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <p><i>Monday, March 19th.</i>&mdash;Captain BATHURST announced
    that the FOOD CONTROLLER would issue an order fixing the retail
    price of swedes at a figure involving a reduction of "something
    like 200 per cent." The FOOD CONTROLLER, as his faithful
    henchman subsequently remarked, "is always doing his best," but
    if he can really reduce the price of a commodity to 100 per
    cent. less than nothing I hope he will not confine his activity
    to a solitary vegetable.</p>

    <p>I am afraid that envy was the predominant feeling aroused by
    Mr. SNOWDEN'S story of the family in New Cavendish Street which
    secured in a single order from a single firm no less than
    sixty-three pounds of sugar. Lest any Hon. Members should be
    tempted to try and do likewise Captain BATHURST promptly
    announced that another order prohibiting hoarding would shortly
    be issued. The House cheered, for, as a journalist Member
    remarked with gloomy satisfaction, "It is only fair that 'no
    posters' should be followed by 'no hoarding.'"</p>

    <p>The PRIME MINISTER paid one of his angelic visits to the
    House to give the latest information of the revolution in
    Russia. His description of it as "one of the landmarks in the
    history of the world" evoked loud cheers, but even louder were
    those which came from the Nationalist benches when he remarked
    that "free peoples are the best defenders of their own
    honour."</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, March 20th.</i>&mdash;A long cross-examination
    of the representative of the Air Board produced one valuable
    statement which Members generally might bear in mind. Mr.
    BILLING asked if it was not "in the public interest or in the
    interests of this House" that certain contracts should be
    discussed. Fixing him with his eye-glass, Major BAIRD replied,
    "No, the interests of the House and of the public, I take it,
    are the same as the interests of the nation."</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:40%;">

        <p>DEFENSIVE DUET BY MESSRS. ASQUITH AND WINSTON
        CHURCHILL.</p>
    </div>

    <p>If there was any lingering doubt as to the main
    responsibility for the inception&mdash;as apart from the
    carrying out&mdash;of the Dardanelles affair Mr. CHURCHILL
    himself must have removed it. Unlike his former chief he
    welcomes the publication of the Report, which in his opinion
    has shared among a number of eminent personages a burden
    formerly borne by himself alone. But his enthusiasm for the
    project as it originally formed itself in his fertile brain is
    undiminished, and he still marvels that for the want of a
    little further sacrifice we should have abandoned the chance of
    cutting Turkey out of the War, and uniting in one friendly
    federation the States of the Balkans.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, March 21st.</i>&mdash;General MAUDE'S
    manifesto to the people of Baghdad, with its allusions to the
    tyranny under which they had long been suffering, did not
    escape the eagle eye of Mr. DEVLIN, ever anxious to scarify
    British hypocrisy. So he drafted a long question to the PRIME
    MINISTER, embodying the most salient passages of the manifesto.
    Much to his disgust it appeared on the Paper without its "most
    beautiful and striking passages." The SPEAKER explained that he
    had blue-pencilled "a good deal of Oriental and flowery
    language not suitable to our Western climate." Not the least
    part of the joke is the rumour that the manifesto was largely
    the work of a Member of the House well versed in Eastern
    lore.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, March 22nd.</i>&mdash;The Ministry of National
    Service, being unprovided at present with a Parliamentary
    Secretary, is supposed to be represented in the House by Mr.
    ARTHUR HENDERSON. But as the Member for Barnard Castle has
    important functions to perform in the War Cabinet and is rarely
    in the House he usually deputes some other Member of the
    Government to answer Questions addressed to him. To-day the lot
    fell upon Mr. BECK, who good-temperedly explained, when a
    shower of "supplementaries" rained down upon him, that he
    really knew nothing about the Department he was temporarily
    representing. This led to a tragedy, for Mr. SWIFT MACNEILL
    worked himself into a paroxysm of excitement over this
    constitutional enormity, and finally sat down on his hat. "I
    only wish his head had been in it," muttered a brother
    Irishman&mdash;from Ulster.</p>

    <p>Believers in "the hidden hand," which is supposed to
    paralyse our military efforts, are divided in opinion as to
    whether this cryptic member is most actively employed by Lord
    HALDANE, Sir WILLIAM ROBERTSON or Sir EYRE CROWE,
    Assistant-Secretary to the Foreign Office. They will probably
    regard Lord ROBERT CECIL'S statement that some seven years ago
    Sir EYRE drew up a memorandum calling the attention of Sir
    EDWARD GREY to the grave dangers that threatened this country
    from Germany as further evidence of his duplicity. The rest of
    the world will rejoice at Lord ROBERT'S spirited vindication of
    "one of the ablest of our public servants," who, despite Miss
    CHRISTABEL PANKHURST, is not one of "the three black crows" of
    legendary fame.</p>

    <p>When Sir H. DALZIEL, at the outset of his appeal to the
    Government to make another attempt to settle the Irish
    Question, promised that he would not "explore the noxious
    vapours of the past," I feared the worst. But he was as good as
    his word, and spared us any gruesome excavations in ancient
    Irish history. Major HILLS did even better by implying that it
    was only during the last ten years that the question had warped
    and diverted our domestic politics. If all Irishmen were as
    reasonable and moderate as Mr. RONALD McNEILL showed himself
    this afternoon it would not need settling, for it would never
    have arisen. He only asked, if sacrifices were necessary, that
    Ulster should not alone be expected to make them. Sir HAMAR
    GREENWOOD, as the great-grandson of a Canadian rebel who took
    twelve sons into the field&mdash;"almost his whole family,"
    added his descendant&mdash;insisted that the Colonial method of
    securing Home Rule was the best&mdash;first agree among
    yourselves, and then go to the Imperial Parliament to sanction
    your scheme. And perhaps, after the conciliatory spirit
    displayed in to-day's debate, that is not so impossible oven in
    Ireland as it seemed a few weeks ago. Hitherto every attempt of
    the British Sisyphus to roll the Stone of Destiny up the Hill
    of Tara has found a couple of Irishmen at the top ready to roll
    it down again. Let us hope that this time they will co-operate
    to instal it there as the throne of a loyal and united
    Ireland.</p>

    <h2>DE PROFUNDIS.</h2>

    <p>When I went round the trenches a day or two before we were
    to move in, the great frost was still in possession; but there
    was a mild feeling in the air.</p>

    <p>"I can thoroughly recommend these trenches to you, Sir,"
    said the occupier in a businesslike manner. "Commodious and
    well built, fitted throughout with the latest pattern
    duck-boards and reached by three charmingly sequestered
    communication trenches, named Hic, Haec and Hoc. The dug-outs
    are well equipped and well sunk. The whole would form an ideal
    retreat for gentlemen of quiet tastes."</p>

    <p>"Good. And the people over the way?"</p>

    <p>"Unobtrusive and retiring to a degree."</p>

    <p>"In fact," I said, "a most select neighbourhood&mdash;unless
    it thaws."</p>

    <p>He dropped pleasantries and answered very seriously. "If it
    thaws, Heaven help you. There's enough water frozen up in these
    walls to drown the lot of you."</p>

    <p>It did thaw.</p>

    <p>When we relieved, we waded up to the line through miles of
    trenches all knee-deep in water, to the accompaniment of
    ominous splashes as the sides began to fall in. When daylight
    came we found our select estate converted into a system of
    canals filled with a substance varying in consistency from
    coffee to glue. Hic, Haec and Hoc, owing to the wear and tear
    of constant traffic, became especially gluey, and after a time
    we rechristened them respectively the Great Ooze, the Little
    Ooze and the River Styx&mdash;the last not solely in reference
    to its adhesive qualities, but also because such a number of
    things went West in it. Some time after the original
    duck-boards had sunk out of our depth we could still move along
    Styx on a solid bottom composed of lost gum-boots, abandoned
    rations and the like. At last, when Frankie, struggling up to
    the line with the rum ration, was forced to dump his precious
    burden in order to save his life, we pronounced Styx impassable
    and thenceforth proceeded along the top after dusk.</p>

    <p>The Great Ooze still remained just possible for those whose
    business took them back and forward during the day, but even
    here were spots in which it was worse than unwise to linger. As
    I squelched painfully through one of these on our last day in
    the line, I found one Private Harrison firmly embedded to the
    top of his thigh-boots. He told me he had been struggling
    vainly for about an hour.</p>

    <p>"Give me your hands," I said.</p>

    <p>I tugged, but could get no proper purchase. Harrison grew
    gradually black in the face, but remained immovable. I tried
    another plan. I turned about, and Harrison clasped his hands
    round my neck. Then I walked away.... At least that was the
    idea.</p>

    <p>"Harrison," I said anxiously after a determined struggle,
    "were you standing on the duckboards?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, Sir. I still am."</p>

    <p>"Heavens, so am I. Let go. I've got to get myself out
    now."</p>

    <p>By using Harrison as a stepping-stone to higher things I
    just managed to heave myself out. I surveyed him panting.</p>

    <p>"In about an hour it'll be dusk. I'll bring some men and a
    rope and haul you out then. If that fails we'll simply have to
    hand you over as trench stores when we get relieved."</p>

    <p>As soon as Fritz's wire had disappeared into the gathering
    gloom I took out my little rescue party. We threw the captive a
    rope and began to pull scientifically under direction of a
    sergeant skilled in tugs-of-war.</p>

    <p>"Heave, you men," I whispered excitedly. "He's coming."</p>

    <p>He was, but without his boots. Inch by inch we dragged him
    out of them. The strain was terrific. Suddenly&mdash;much too
    suddenly&mdash;the tension broke. Harrison shot into the air
    and fell again with a dull thud in the Ooze beside his boots,
    while the rescue party collapsed head over heels into an
    adjacent shell-hole.</p>

    <p>Harrison seemed a little peevish, but consented to try
    again. The rope tautened, and there was a sharp crack from
    below.</p>

    <p>"'Old on," cried the prisoner sharply, "me braces is
    bust."</p>

    <p>"Can't think o' braces now," grunted my burly sergeant.
    "Heave-ho, lads, up she comes!"</p>

    <p>Harrison was pulled clean out of his nether garments,
    cursing bitterly as the wind caught his bare legs, and hung
    suspended between earth and water, amid ribald comments from
    above.</p>

    <p>One more pull would do it. But at that moment Fritz,
    apparently feeling that we weren't taking his war seriously
    enough, opened up with a machine-gun. The rescue party dropped
    the rope and rolled heavily into the shell-hole, and the sorely
    tried Harrison found himself back again, but face downwards
    this time, and held by his arms up to the elbows.</p>

    <p>We could hear horrible language, and after a moment, all
    being quiet, I crawled to the edge and looked over. His last
    struggle had split Harrison's tunic and pulled it clean off his
    back; and now, with his shirt-tail trailing dismally in the
    Ooze, he was making the best of his own way to the
    dressing-station, ungratefully consigning his gallant rescuers
    to complete and lasting perdition as he went.</p>

    <h2>THE FRUIT MERCHANT.</h2>

    <p>"I feel regular down this morning, Sir," said Private Thomas
    Weeks, as I seated myself beside his bed; "regular down, I
    do."</p>

    <p>It was such a very unusual greeting from this source that I
    said anxiously, "Not the leg gone wrong?"</p>

    <p>"No, the old leg's fine. It's the stopping of the imports."
    He indicated the morning paper which he had just laid aside.
    "It's just about bust up my old business."</p>

    <p>I took the paper and glanced down the list of prohibited
    articles. Clocks and parts thereof, perfumery, and quails
    (live) caught my eye. I didn't think it could be any of
    these.</p>

    <p>"What was your business?" I asked.</p>

    <p>"Fruit merchant, Sir. Barrow trade, you understand. 'Awker,
    some calls it. But it don't much matter now what it's called,
    'cos it's bust up."</p>

    <p>"Not quite bust up, is it?" I said. "Only a bit cut down for
    a time."</p>

    <p>"That may be," he said, "but I got a strong affection for
    the trade, Sir, a very strong affection, and I can't 'elp
    feeling it. Why, rightly speaking, it was the fruit trade what
    got me my D.C.M."</p>

    <p>"Did it though? How was that?"</p>

    <p>"Well, it was like this. I bin callin' fruit a good many
    years. I could call fruit with anyone. When I calls ''Oo sez a
    blood orange?' at Kennington Lane, you could 'ear it pretty
    well as far as New Cross. Same with ''Ave a banana?' If you're
    to do the trade you must make the people 'ear. It ain't no good
    bein' like them chaps what stands in the gutter and whispers,
    'Umberella ring a penny,' to their boots."</p>

    <p>"But what about the D.C.M.?"</p>

    <p>"I'm comin' to it, Sir. You see, I got it in connection with
    a little bit o' work Trones Wood way. Through various circs,
    fault o' nobody really, me and Sam Corney found ourselves alone
    alongside a dug-out full o' Bosches. If we'd 'ad a few bombs
    we'd 'a' bin all right, but we 'adn't. I sez to Sam, 'We must
    scare 'em,' I sez, and I shouts, '<i>'Oo says a blood
    orange?</i>' at the top o' my voice into the dug-out, which was
    dark, of course, and I stands in the doorway with my bayonet
    ready. I can't say what they mistook it for. Crack o' doom, Sam
    sez. But eight come out o' that dug-out with their 'ands up. I
    sent Sam off 'ome with 'em, though they'd 'a' gone with no
    escort at all, I reckon, bein' sort o' stunned. And I went on
    down the trench.</p>

    <p>"At the turn there was another dug-out. '<i>'Ave a
    banana?</i>' I yells, and out come ten of 'em, cryin' for
    mercy. I took 'em back to what we calls Petticoat Lane and
    'ands 'em over and come up again. But I didn't get no more
    barrow-work that day, and my D.C.M. was for them prisoners
    right enough. So now you see what I feels like about the fruit
    business. It's like an old pal bein' done in."</p>

    <p>"I shouldn't worry too much about it," I said. "You've each
    had a bit of a knock-out; but you'll soon be on your legs
    again, and so will your barrow, and going strong, both of
    you."</p>

    <h2>THE HARDSHIPS OF BILLETS.</h2>

    <p>Jim and me could never 'ave got through the six weeks we was
    billeted with Mrs. Sweedle if we 'adn't been 'ardened by Mrs.
    Larkins in the way I 'ave described.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Sweedle were a widow woman with a big family, besides a
    aged father and a brother who suffered with fits. The billetin'
    orficer was afraid she wouldn't he able to take us in, but Mrs.
    Sweedle was willin' and eager.</p>

    <p>"Bless their hearts, that I will," she said; "it shall never
    be said I turned a soldier from my door. Nobody knows better
    than I do what soldiers is in an 'ouse. Always merry and bright
    and ready to put their 'ands to anything when a poor woman's
    work's never done and she's delicate and liable to the
    sick-'eadache in the mornin's. There's the week's clothes to go
    through the wringer, but I know what soldiers is for a wringer;
    they can't leave it alone. And if I 'appens to overlay meself I
    know there's no cause to worry about Grandfer's cup o' tea, nor
    yet Bobby and Tom and Albert gettin' off to school tidy. Like
    as not they'll do me more credit than if I washed 'em meself;
    there's nobody like a soldier for puttin' a polish on
    children."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Sweedle overlaid herself the very first mornin', and
    sent word by Albert if we would be so kind as make her a cup o'
    tea when we was makin' Grandfer's it might save her a doctor;
    and the wood for the fire was out in the yard, and she knew,
    bein' soldiers, we should chop her a barrer-load while we was
    about it; and when she crawled downstairs presently the
    breakfast things would be washed and put away, as was the 'abit
    of soldiers, and very likely the pertaters peeled for
    dinner.</p>

    <p>It bein' a strange 'ouse and we not knowin' where to put our
    'ands on anythin', and, when we'd got the kettle to boil, not
    bein' able to let it out of our sight owin' to the youngest
    little Sweedle wantin' to drink out of the spout, Jim and me
    was regler drove. We was as near late for parade as we 'ave
    ever been in our lives. Mrs. Sweedle was very upset. "I know
    what soldiers is for punctuality," she said, "a minute late and
    they're court-martialled. How would it be if you was to lay the
    fire over-night and scrub over the floor? It 'ud save ye a lot
    in the mornin', if so be I'm forced to keep me bed."</p>

    <p>We done as she advised, and it were fortunate. She 'ad
    another sick-'eadache the next day, and sent word by Albert
    would we be so good as bake her a mouthful of toast; she knew
    what soldiers' toast was like, it give ye a appetite to look at
    it, thin and crisp, with the butter laid on smooth as cream and
    cut in fingers.</p>

    <p>We never run no risk after that. 'Owever dog-tired we was
    and 'owever Mrs. Sweedle seemed in 'ealth we always got the
    work forward over-night, and when we could catch 'old of Bobby
    and Tom and Albert we washed 'em to save time in the mornin'
    and parted their 'air.</p>

    <p>One day Mrs. Sweedle were well enough to get up. "I know
    who's goin' to 'ave a treat now," she said. Our 'arts leapt. We
    did 'ope she might be goin' to say we was to sit down to our
    breakfasts.</p>

    <p>"Grandfer's goin' to be shaved, and not 'ave to pay tuppence
    out of 'is poor pension," she said. "There's nobody can shave
    like a soldier." And when Jim 'ad got the old man by the nose
    she said to me, "I can see what you want to be at, shakin'
    these mats with your strong arm and savin' me comin' on
    giddy."</p>

    <p>It were very 'ard at first, but after a bit Jim and me got
    into the work at Mrs. Sweedle's and was just able to get
    through with it, except the mornin' her brother 'ad a fit when
    we was racin' to finish the washin'-up. That fair broke our
    backs. We 'ad a sort of seizure on parade and 'ad to fall out
    till we got our breaths back.</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned
    Clerks</i>.)</p>

    <p><i>Alfred Lyttelton: An Account of his Life</i>, by EDITH
    LYTTELTON (LONGMANS), is a most fascinating book. Mrs. ALFRED
    LYTTELTON might perhaps have contented herself with writing a
    formal biography of her husband. It would have been difficult
    for her, but she might, as I say, have done it. Instead of this
    she takes her readers by the hand in the friendliest manner and
    admits them with her into the heart and soul of the man with
    whom she was for twenty years associated. She shows him as what
    he was, a noble and upright English gentleman, straightforward
    and tender-hearted, and beloved in a quite exceptional measure
    by all who were privileged to be his friends. I can only be
    grateful to Mrs. LYTTELTON for having interpreted her duty in
    this manner, and for having carried it out with so sure a hand.
    As I read her pages I saw again in my mind's eye the
    loose-limbed, curly-headed young son of Anak as he swung down
    Jesus Lane, Cambridge, or as he witched the world with noble
    cricketing at Fenner's or at Lord's. It is good to be able to
    remember him. His Eton tutor described him as being "like a
    running stream with the sun on it," and there was, indeed, a
    charm about him that was irresistible. Mrs. LYTTELTON devotes a
    beautiful chapter to the memory of ALFRED'S first wife, LAURA,
    who died after one short year of happiness. "She was a flame,"
    says Mrs. LYTTELTON, "beautiful, dancing, ardent, leaping up
    from the earth in joyous rapture, touching everyone with fire
    as she passed. The wind of life was too fierce for such a
    spirit&mdash;she could not live in it. Surely it was Love that
    gathered her." I have only one little bone to pick, and that
    not with Mrs. LYTTELTON, but with Lord MIDLETON, who in a page
    or two of reminiscences describes as one of ALFRED'S triumphs
    at the Bar his appearance as counsel for the Warden of Morton,
    Mr. GEORGE BRODRICK. The Warden, having said something
    offensive about Mr. DILLON, was hailed before the Parnell
    Commission for contempt of court. ALFRED put in an affidavit by
    the Warden, in which the whole thing was said to be a joke, and
    in his speech he chaffed Mr. REID (now Lord LOREBURN), who was
    counsel for Mr. DILLON, for being a Scotsman, with a natural
    incapacity for seeing a joke. So far Lord MIDLETON; but he
    omits Mr. REID'S crushing retort. "Even a Scotsman," said Mr.
    REID, "may be pardoned for not seeing a joke which has to be
    certified by affidavit."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Mr. JEFFERY E. JEFFERY has been playing cheerful tricks on
    the British public. We must forgive him, because he has for a
    long time been doing far worse than that to the Huns; but it is
    undeniable that in following the winding trail of his beloved
    guns we are in no small danger of losing our sense of
    direction. This is because along with imaginary tales, some of
    them written before August, 1914, when of course he could not
    fix precisely the chronology and locality of his fights, he has
    mixed almost indiscriminately the record of his own actual
    experiences during two distinct phases of the War. Not until
    the last page does he abandon the jest to explain&mdash;with
    something of a school-boy grin&mdash;just where fact and
    fiction meet, and so enable me to recover from my bewilderment
    and pass on a word of warning. Once on your guard, however, you
    will find his story of the <i>Servants of the Guns</i> (SMITH,
    ELDER), and more especially the first half of it (dealing, in
    diary form, with his recent adventures as an officer of
    Artillery&mdash;he does not state his present rank), as vivid
    and real as anything of the sort you have seen. Field-gun
    warfare of to-day&mdash;mathematics, telephones and
    mud&mdash;with little more of old-time dash and jingle than the
    hope that some to-morrow may revive them in the Great
    Pursuit&mdash;this is his theme; and above all the loyalty of
    the gunner to his guns. Even the story-book part in the middle
    of the volume speaks of this finely and movingly; but here and
    there amongst his personal experiences comes a passage less
    consciously composed that tells it even better in the bareness
    of a great simplicity.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Mr. J.D. BERESFORD'S new story, <i>House-Mates</i>
    (CASSELL), might be regarded as an awful warning to young
    gentlemen seeking bachelor-apartments. Because, if the hero had
    been a little more careful about his fellow-lodgers at No. 73
    Keppel Street, he would not, in the first place, have been
    defrauded of a large sum of money, or, in the second, have been
    involved in a peculiarly revolting murder. (The special
    hatefulness of this murder strikes me as rather superfluous.
    But this by the way.) On the other hand, of course, he would
    never have married the heroine, and we should have missed a
    very agreeable study of expanding adolescence. This, I take it,
    is the real motive of Mr. BERESFORD'S story, as exemplified by
    his pleasant introductory metaphor of the chicken and the egg.
    From the feminine point of view, indeed, the tale might be not
    inaptly labelled "Treatise on Cub-hunting." Anyhow, what with
    strange actresses and I.D.B. criminals and painted ladies and
    reviewers (they <i>were</i> a queer lot at No. 73!) the hero
    completes his tenancy with enough experience of life, chiefly
    on its shadowy side, to last him for some time. An original and
    rather appealing story, told with a good deal of charm.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>I was waiting for it, and now, behold, it has come. In
    <i>The Shining Heights</i> (MILLS AND BOON) the War is over and
    we have to do with some of the results of it. Unfortunately
    Miss I.A.R. WYLIE is very chary about dates, and she is not
    encouraging about the changes which most of us hope will come
    with peace. "Social conditions indeed," she writes, "had
    scarcely moved. Universal brotherhood was not ... and, for the
    vast majority of men and women it had been easiest to go back
    to the old work, the old pleasure, the old love and the old
    hate." Well, I don't know much about universal brotherhood, but
    for the rest I sincerely hope that these gloomy
    prognostications are wrong. As for the story, laid in the
    Delectable Duchy, no one needs to be told that Miss WYLIE is a
    novelist of considerable power and capacity, and here she has
    chosen a theme of very real interest. It is the rivalry of two
    men, one of whom had returned from the War with wounds and a
    V.C., while the other had never taken part in it because he
    believed (with justification) that he was on the point of
    making a discovery of value to humanity. The story is well
    constructed and well told, but I am beginning to think that it
    is time for Cornwall to be declared a prohibited area for all
    novelists except Mr. CHARLES MARRIOTT and "Q."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Yet more theatrical recollections. The latest volume of them
    is <i>My Remembrances</i> (CASSELL), in which Mr. EDWARD H.
    SOTHERN recounts, with the pleasant humour to be expected from
    him, what he quaintly (and quite unjustifiably) calls "The
    Melancholy Tale of Me." One has heard that Mr. SOTHERN, now
    that he has retired from the stage, proposes to live in
    England; the book explains such an intention by its evidence of
    the writer's intense love for this country. Naturally he has a
    rich stock of good stories, amongst which I was delighted to
    welcome yet once again that old favourite about the departing
    spectator who, on being told that two Acts remained to be
    performed, said briefly, "That's why I'm going!" Newer (to me)
    was the <i>Dundreary</i> tale that told how the elder SOTHERN'S
    triumph was actually the result of JEFFERSON'S partiality for
    horse-exercise. The connection I leave you to find out. Like
    all volumes of its kind, <i>My Remembrances</i> abounds in
    photographs. At times, indeed, you may be tempted to consider
    that the domain of the family portrait album has been too
    largely usurped. But there is even about this a friendliness
    which, coupled with the brisk style of its writing, will give
    the book a popularity as wide as that of its author.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We all know that Mr. WILLIAM CAINE has a gay humour, and he
    indulges it liberally, sometimes rollickingly, in <i>The
    Fan</i>. With a candour which I warmly commend he states
    conspicuously that most of these stories have appeared before,
    and he expresses his acknowledgments to various Editors over a
    widish range&mdash;from <i>Macmillan's Magazine</i> to
    <i>London Opinion</i>, and from <i>The English Review</i> to
    <i>Answers</i>. It would be an innocent diversion to have to
    guess which story was written for which Editor. But for
    whatever public the author caters he is, with only one or two
    exceptions, out for fun, and he gets it. Some of his stories
    are pure extravaganzas, but they are written in a style
    unusually good for this kind, and by a very shrewd observer of
    human foibles. Messrs. METHUEN tell us that Mr. CAINE "views
    life from an angle all his own," and although I do not often
    find myself in agreement with publishers' opinions of their own
    wares it is to me a right angle.</p>

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
